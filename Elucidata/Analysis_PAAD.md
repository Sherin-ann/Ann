  <li>The plot above shows the clusters of samples based on their similarity. PC1 represents 13.9% (highest) of variabilty whereas PC2 represents 11.1% of variability betweeen the samples.</li>
  <li>Further, we can see that the neuroendocrine tumors and adenocarcinomas cluster into two separate cohorts</li>
  <li>And finally, the dataset containing only adenocarcinomas and no neuroendocrine tumor samples are retrieved (source code: Adenocarcinoma.ipynb)
