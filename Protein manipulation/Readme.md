  <h3><dt>Dihedral angle</dt></h3>
  <dd align="justify">Dihedral or torsion angle in proteins is defined as the angle between two planes consisting of 4 atoms.
  The program &nbsp<i>dihedrel_angle.py</i>&nbsp&nbsp calculates the dihedral angle between the points a,b,c,d. The X,Y,Z cordinates of a,b,c,d are taken as input from the user.</dd>

<h3><dt>Classification of Amino acids</dt></h3>
<dd align="justify">Amino acids can be classified as polar, non-polar, neutral, acidic or basic based on the properties of their side chains. The program &nbsp&nbsp<i>classification.py</i>&nbsp&nbsp  takes an amino acid as input from user and returns the category it belongs to.</dd>

<h3><dt>Weight and Charge</dt></h3>
<dd>The program &nbsp&nbsp<i>weight_charge.py</i>&nbsp&nbsp calculates the weight and charge of the protein sequence taken as input from the user.</dd>

<h3><dt>Frequency</dt></h3>
<dd align="justify">The program &nbsp&nbsp<i>frequency_aa.py</i>&nbsp&nbsp calculates the per amino acid frequency of the protein sequence taken as input from the user.</dd>
